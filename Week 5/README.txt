In week 5 of the bootcamp the task was to set up an AWS machine and an AWS postgreSQL database. Metabase was installed on the EC2 machine and connected to the RDS postgreSQL database. A dashboard visualizing data from the RDS database was set up.
Writing and retrival of data was done from this jupyter notebook.
A backup of the RDS is found in 'metabase_archive.zip'.
