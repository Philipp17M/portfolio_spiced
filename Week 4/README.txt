the py-scripts 'scraping.py' and 'predictions.py' do the same things as the notebooks 'Web scraping.*' and 'Bag of words and artist prediction.*' with the only difference being that the py-scripts can be called from the command line with artist name and target directory as arguments for 'scraping.py' and a user input for the 'predictions.py' to input a line of lyrics to recognise the artist.
