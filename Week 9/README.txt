Task in week 9:
- find source code in 'src' directory

- Capture images with webcam of a range of objects.
- read-in images with respective labels
- set up a CNN and train on image data
- make predictions on test data

- in 'CNN thing' this basic approach is taken
- in 'CNN retrain VGG16' the pre-trained image model VGG16 is used and only the dense layers are retrained to perhaps gain a better accuracy for live-image classification.

- 'capture.py' and 'utils.py' are provided through the course material
